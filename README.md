### Raw installation guide
To install and compile the game on your calculator, you need to install the CE C/C++ toolchain from https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain. After that, you must put the files inside another folder named whatever, and then use the cedev.bat file and run the command `cd YOUR_FOLDER` into the terminal, and then type `make`. Using the file created in bin (`.8xp`), you can now transfer that file onto your calculator/emulator and edit the file as you wish.
