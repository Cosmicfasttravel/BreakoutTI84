### What this is
This is a fun, work-in-progress calculator game. Ensure you download the latest release for the most up-to-date bug fixes (Installation guide below).
## 
### Gameplay:
- Note that this is not the final version, and it is subject to change.
- Note also that this is laggier than the release version
- Also this is not the current version, it is just the last I recorded

### Installation guide (will be moved to releases)
To install the program onto the calculator, you need to install the C libraries from https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries, then you download the latest release from the release page, and install the .8xp file onto your calculator through the TI-Connect CE software. Note: it must be run through a shell, or it will not work. Use artifice for the shell; it is very effective
### Raw installation guide (will be moved to a separate release when done)
To install and compile the game on your calculator with the source code, you need to install the CE C/C++ toolchain from https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain. After that, you must put the files inside another folder named whatever, and then use the `cedev.bat` file and run the command `cd YOUR_FOLDER` into the terminal, and then type `make`. Using the file created in bin (`.8xp`), you can now transfer that file onto your calculator/emulator and edit the file as you wish.
